title: OpenMensa Feed v2

# Feed v2 (Draft)

## Availability

As XML Schema: [http://openmensa.org/open-mensa-v2.xsd](http://openmensa.org/open-mensa-v2.xsd)

## Example

<%= xml(file_in('static/feed_v2.xml')) %>

## Validation

If you build your feed's xml carefully (simply copy the first 5 lines from our example, all the XML and schema foo will be done automatically for you), you may upload it to a [XML validator](http://www.validome.org/xml/validate/) that recognizes XML schemas to check for validity.

## Changes to [v1](/feed/v1/)

* new *openmensa* root element
* rename cafeteria to *canteen*
* price *role*s
* closing times on day granularity

## *openmensa* root element

A new root element with a more generic name that we want to preserve across future feed versions. The *version* attribute should equal 2.0.

## Price roles

Because different prices may apply to different groups of people and we want to show, for which group we introduced several roles:

* pupils
* students
* employees (of your organization
* others (people that do not belong to your organization or to any other group listed here).

## Closing times

Instead of specifying one or more categories for a day, you can include only a *closed* for a *day* to explicitly indicate that a canteen has closed.
