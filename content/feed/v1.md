# Feed v1 (deprecated)

## Availability

As DTD: [http://openmensa.org/open-mensa-v1.dtd](http://openmensa.org/open-mensa-v1.dtd)

As XML Schema (preferred): [http://openmensa.org/open-mensa-v1.xsd](http://openmensa.org/open-mensa-v1.xsd)

Note: the DTD will be abandoned as of [Feed v2](/feed/v2/) so we advice you to switch to the XML schema as early as possible!

## Example

<%= xml(file_in('static/feed_v1.xml')) %>

## Validation

If you build your feed's xml carefully (simply copy the first 5 lines from our example, all the XML and schema foo will be done automatically for you), you may upload it to a [XML validator](http://www.validome.org/xml/validate/) that recognizes XML schemas to check for validity.

## Description

This feed format is designed to serve meal data for a single canteen in a single feed. So to serve multiple canteens you need multiple feeds.
The *cafeteria* root element has a version attribute with value 1.0.

The meals are grouped by day (having a *date* attribute as YYYY-MM-DD) and by categories (having a *name* attribute).

We introduced categories to allow *meal* grouping/classification based on e.g. some product line or desk as most canteens do.

## Meals

All properties associated with a meal are realized as sub-elements as there are:

* a *name*
* (zero or more) *note*s
* (zero or more) *price*s (in â‚¬)

The name of a meal, e.g. "Rinderhacksteak mit Kartoffeln". Shouldn't be more than a couple of words or a sentence in maximum.

Additional text may go into several notes: A note often resembles a properties of the associated meal like the ingredients used or some important annotations.

One drawback is that you, in case of multiple prices, cannot specify for which group of people a price is valid. That is fixed in [v2](/feed/v2/).
